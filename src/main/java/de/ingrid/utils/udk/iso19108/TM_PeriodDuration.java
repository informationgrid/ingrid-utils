/**
 * Representation of an ISO 19108 TM_PeriodDuration
 * 
 * Documentation from http://www.ncits.org/ref-docs/ISO_DIS_19108.pdf
 * 
 * TM_PeriodDuration uses the format specified by ISO 8601 for exchanging information about the duration of a
 * period. It allows duration to be expressed in terms of multiple units of time, specifically years, months, days, hours,
 * minutes, and seconds. Although individual values are optional, a value shall be provided for at least one unit.
 * 
 * Attributes:
 * a) Designator:CharacterString = P is a mandatory element which designates that the following characters represent the duration of a period
 * b) years [0..1]:CharacterString is a positive integer, followed by the character "Y" which indicates the number of years in the period
 * c) months [0..1]:CharacterString is a positive integer followed by the character "M" which indicates the number of months in the period
 * d) days [0..1]:CharacterString is a positive integer followed by the character "D" which indicates the number of days in the period
 * e) timeIndicator [0..1]:CharacterString = "T" shall be included whenever the sequence includes values for units of less than a day
 * f) hours [0..1]:CharacterString is a positive integer followed by the character "H" which indicates the number of hours in the period
 * g) minutes [0..1]:CharacterString is a positive integer followed by the character "H" which indicates the number of minutes in the period
 * h) seconds [0..1]:CharacterString is a positive integer followed by the character "S" which indicates the number of seconds in the period
 * 
 * The value for the rightmost unit may be expressed as a positive decimal fraction rather than as a positive integer.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE A duration of 5 days, 4 hours, and 30.7 minutes is represented as P5DT4H30.7M.
 * NOTE Although this format is defined in ISO 8601 for use with dates in the Gregorian calendar and times in UTC,
 * TM_PeriodDuration may be used as the data type for expressing length or distance whenever temporal positions are referenced
 * to a calendar that describes dates in terms of years, months and days and a clock that describes times in hours, minutes and
 * seconds.
